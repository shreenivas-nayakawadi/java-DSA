    DP : an optimized recursion

    DP: dynamic programming is a technique in computer  programming that helps to effeciently solve class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructures

1. how to identify DP?
    a. optimal problem
    b. some choices is given (multiple branches in the given tree)
