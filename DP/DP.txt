    𝘿𝙋 : an optimized recursion

    𝘿𝙋: dynamic programming is a technique in computer  programming that helps to effeciently solve class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructures

 𝙝𝙤𝙬 𝙩𝙤 𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙛𝙮 𝘿𝙋?
    a. optimal problem
    b. some choices is given (multiple branches in the given tree)

𝙬𝙖𝙮𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝘿𝙋
    𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻(𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗺)
        normal recursion
        store subproblems in storage and reuse whenever required

    𝘁𝗮𝗯𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻(𝗯𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝘂𝗽)
        dp using iteration without using recursion
        more effcient than memoization
